            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Astro Events was born out of a passion for connecting people and creating memorable experiences. As a software engineering student at ALX-Holberton School, I embarked on this project within a month to showcase my skills and create a practical solution for event management.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inspiration behind Astro Events came from my own experiences attending and organizing events. I realized the need for a user-friendly platform that streamlines the entire event lifecycle, from planning and promotion to registration and attendee engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is not just a requirement for Holberton School; it's a personal endeavor to contribute something meaningful to the community. I wanted to create a platform that empowers event organizers and attendees alike, making event culture more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
